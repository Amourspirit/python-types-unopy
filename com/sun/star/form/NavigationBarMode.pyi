"""
a navigation bar is provided and navigation will be performed on the current/active form.

pressing the TAB key from the last control moves the focus to the first control in the tab order of the same record.

This is the default and most often encountered mode.
"""
NONE: NavigationBarModeProto
"""
no navigation bar is provided and navigation on the current form is only possible with the keyboard (TAB/SHIFT TAB).

Note that when this mode is set, a simultaneous TabulatorCycle value of TabulatorCycle.CURRENT means that you cannot travel between records anymore.
"""
PARENT: NavigationBarModeProto
"""
a navigation bar is provided and navigation will be performed on the parent of the current/active form.

This option is usually used for forms containing a grid control only. In such a form, the control has its own navigation elements, so there is no need to use the navigation bar for the form, but rather for its parent.
