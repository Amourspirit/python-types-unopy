class ElementModes:
    """
    Const

    The constant set contains possible modes to open an element.
    
    The modes can be combined by \"or\" operation. ElementModes.READ and ElementModes.WRITE are base modes. A result mode must include one of base modes.

    """
    READ: int = ...
    """
    specifies opening of an element for reading.
    """
    SEEKABLE: int = ...
    """
    specifies opening of a seekable element.
    
    This mode is ignored for Storage elements. This flag makes sense only in combination with ElementModes.READ and/or ElementModes.WRITE.
    """
    SEEKABLEREAD: int = ...
    """
    specifies opening of a seekable element for reading.
    
    This is just a combination of the previous two values. For storages it is the same as ElementModes.READ.
    """
    WRITE: int = ...
    """
    specifies opening of an element for writing.
    """
    READWRITE: int = ...
    """
    specifies opening of an element for reading and writing.
    
    For a stream element is also specifies that it must be seekable.
    """
    TRUNCATE: int = ...
    """
    lets the document be truncated immediately after opening.
    
    This flag makes sense only in combination with ElementModes.WRITE.
    """
    NOCREATE: int = ...
    """
    restricts creation of a new element on opening in case a requested one does not exist.
    
    This flag makes sense only in combination with ElementModes.WRITE.
