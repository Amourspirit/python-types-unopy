    Const

    The constant set contains flags describing miscellaneous characteristics of embedded objects.
    
    The constant values can be combined with \"or\" operation. The first 32 bits are reserved for MS values, they are added because this API is going to be used to embed MS OLE objects into OOo documents, so there should be a possibility to transfer all the possible MS flags to container. In case own specific values should be added those bits can not be used.
