    gets delivered whenever a \"bound\" or \"constrained\" property is changed.
    
    A PropertyChangeEvent object is sent as an argument to the methods of XPropertyChangeListener and XVetoableChangeListener.
    
    Normally such events contain the name and the old and new value of the changed property.
    
    Void values may be provided for the old and new values if their true values are not known.
