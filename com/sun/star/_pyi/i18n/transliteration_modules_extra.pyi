    Extra transliteration module enumeration to use with XTransliteration.loadModule()
    
    The values used in this group need to be different from the ones in TransliterationModules and TransliterationModulesNew!

    The first character of the sentence is put in upper case.

    """
    The first character of the word is put in upper case.
    
    This one is part
    """
    TOGGLE_CASE: Literal[202]
    """
    All characters of the word are to change their case from small letters to capital letters and vice versa.
    """
    IGNORE_DIACRITICS_CTL: Literal[1073741824]
    """
    Ignore diacritics.
    
    Despite the _CTL name suffix this is not only about CTL/Arabic diacritic characters, though these are handled as well, but the transliteration decomposes and removes any diacritic from characters.
    
    Because we cannot extend the TransliterationModules enum we use TransliterationModulesExtra and it will act the same way.

    IGNORE_KASHIDA_CTL: Literal[2048]

    Ignore Kashida mark.
