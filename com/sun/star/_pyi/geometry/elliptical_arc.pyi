    Struct Class

    This structure specifies an arbitrary elliptical arc.
    
    This structure contains all parameters necessary to specify arbitrary elliptical arcs. The parameters are modeled closely after the SVG specification.
    
    As with the parameters below, there are mostly four different ellipses arcs (two different ellipses, on which four different arcs connect start and end point) which satisfy the given set of constrains. Thus, there are two flags indicating which one of those ellipses should be taken.
