    Exception Class

    indicates that the Java Virtual Machine could not be created
    
    This exception can be thrown when the creation of the Java Virtual Machine failed, even if the runtime library could be loaded. Possible reasons for a failure are that JNI_CreateJavaVM returns an error code that reflects a failure, JNI_CreateJavaVM does not return because it tries to quit the process ( _exit), the shared library is corrupted, so that the symbols for JNI_GetDefaultVMInitArgs or JNI_CreateJavaVM cannot be found, etc.
    
    **since**
