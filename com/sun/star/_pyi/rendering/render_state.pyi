        Specifying an empty interface denotes no clipping, i.e. everything rendered to the canvas will be visible (subject to device-dependent constraints, of course). Specifying an empty XPolyPolygon2D, i.e. a poly-polygon containing zero polygons, or an XPolyPolygon2D with any number of empty sub-polygons, denotes the NULL clip. That means, nothing rendered to the canvas will be visible.
