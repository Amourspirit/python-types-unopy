Uses the column name for label generation.

A spreadsheet range A1:A6 could, e.g., result in \"Column A\".

If a range consists of more than one column the result of label generation may be empty. Of course, it could also succeed with a string like \"Columns A to B\".
"""
LONG_SIDE: LabelOriginProto
"""
This is exactly the opposite of SHORT_SIDE.

I.e., if SHORT_SIDE has the same effect as ROW, LONG_SIDE will have the same effect as COLUMN and the other way round.
"""
ROW: LabelOriginProto
"""
Uses the column name for label generation.

A spreadsheet range A2:D2 could, e.g., result in \"Row 2\".

If a range consists of more than one row the result of label generation may be empty. Of course, it could also succeed with a string like \"Rows 1-3\".
"""
SHORT_SIDE: LabelOriginProto
"""
If a range spans a single row over more than one column, this parameter has the same effect as ROW.

If the range spans a single column over more than one row, this is the same as COLUMN.

In case of a range spanning more than one column and row, the shorter range of both should be used (e.g. a spreadsheet range A1:B10 should treat columns as short side).

In case of a rectangular range, or a range that is composed of more than one contiguous sub-regions, the short side cannot be determined, thus XDataSequence.generateLabel() will return an empty sequence.
