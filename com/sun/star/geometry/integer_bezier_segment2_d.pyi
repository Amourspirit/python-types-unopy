    Struct Class

    This structure contains the relevant data for a cubic Bezier curve.
    
    The data is stored integer-valued. The last point of the segment is taken from the first point of the following segment, and thus not included herein. That is, when forming a polygon out of cubic Bezier segments, each two consecutive IntegerBezierSegment2Ds define the actual curve, with the very last segment providing only the end point of the last curve, and the remaining members ignored.
