    Struct Class

    Contains all information needed to define a texture.
    
    This structure contains all information necessary to define a texture. A texture describes the filled area of polygonal shapes, providing its own transformation matrix, repeat mode, and transparency.
    
    To achieve uniformity, if this texture has a bitmap set, it is scaled in such a way that it will cover the same [0,1]x[0,1] box as the hatch and the gradient. The transformation member can then be used to scale the complete texture as it fits suit.
