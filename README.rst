=======================
LibreOffice API Typings
=======================

This project allow typings for the full `LibreOffice API <https://api.libreoffice.org/>`_

WHY
===

Working with `LibreOffice API <https://api.libreoffice.org/>`_ in a modern code editor such as `Visual Studio Code <https://code.visualstudio.com/>`_
there is not type support for `LibreOffice API <https://api.libreoffice.org/>`_ This project solves that Issue.

VERSION
=======

This package is for Version ``7.4`` + of `LibreOffice API <https://api.libreoffice.org/>`_.

From one version of LibreOffice to the next, generally speaking, the API does not changed much.
Because this is the case it is very likely this current version of ``LibreOffice API Typings``
will work fine with other versions of LibreOffice. This a typing package so not much can go wrong in other versions.

Installation
============

PIP
---

**types-unopy** on `PyPI <https://pypi.org/project/types-unopy/>`_

.. code-block:: bash

    $ pip install types-unopy

For version ``7.3`` (or less) of LibreOffice.

.. code-block:: bash

    $ pip install "types-unopy<1.0"

CONDA
-----

**types-unopy** on `Anaconda <https://anaconda.org/conda-forge/types-unopy>`_

.. code-block:: bash

    $ conda install -c conda-forge types-unopy

For version ``7.3`` (or less) of LibreOffice.

.. code-block:: bash

    $ conda install -c conda-forge "types-unopy<1.0"

Related
=======

`Types-ScriptForge leverages <https://github.com/Amourspirit/python-types-scriptforge>`_ ``types-unopy``. By installing
Types-ScriptForge into your project you will also automatically install ``types-unopy``.

USAGE
=====

Not all object in `LibreOffice API <https://api.libreoffice.org/>`_ can be directly imported.

Any UNO object that is a *service* cannot be imported at runtime.

For instance if you need to import ``SheetCellRange`` so it can be used
as type the following will fail at runtime.

.. code-block:: python

    >>> from com.sun.star.sheet import SheetCellRange
    ImportError: No module named 'com' (or 'com.sun.star.sheet.SheetCellRange' is unknown)

The solution is to use `TYPE_CHECKING <https://docs.python.org/3/library/typing.html#typing.TYPE_CHECKING>`_.

.. code-block:: python

    >>> from __future__ import annotations
    >>> from typing import TYPE_CHECKING
    >>> if TYPE_CHECKING:
    ...     from com.sun.star.sheet import SheetCellRange
    ...

Anything imported in the ``TYPE_CHECKING`` block will not be available at runtime.
For this reason types inside the ``TYPE_CHECKING`` must be wrapped in quotes **OR** ``from __future__ import annotations`` must be the first line of the module.

Example of wrapping type in quotes.

.. code-block:: python

    def do_work(range: 'SheetCellRange') -> None: ...

Known Issues
============

Enums
-----

There is no enum classes in API only enum members.

To access the enum members they must be imported directly.

For example to import ``com.sun.star.beans.PropertyState.DIRECT_VALUE``


If you need the behavior of regular Enum Classes consider using `ooouno <https://github.com/Amourspirit/python-ooouno>`_

.. code-block:: python

    >>> from com.sun.star.beans import PropertyState
    ImportError: No module named 'com' (or 'com.sun.star.beans.PropertyState' is unknown
    >>>
    >>> from com.sun.star.beans.PropertyState import DIRECT_VALUE
    >>> DIRECT_VALUE.value
    'DIRECT_VALUE'
    >>>
    >>> type(DIRECT_VALUE)
    <class 'uno.Enum'>

Special Cases
=============

ImportError
-----------

By default an ``ImportError`` is raised when importing form ``com.sun.star`` at runtime.
This is by design as the import error triggers ``uno`` to search LibreOffice API for actual import;
Otherwise, ``com.sun.star`` is seen a namespace import and ``uno`` is ignored.

In some cases the ``ImportError`` may need to be suppressed.

Suppressing ``ImportError`` is accomplished by adding ``"ooouno_ignore_import_error"`` to environment and setting it to ``"True"``

.. code-block:: python

    >>> import os
    >>> os.environ["ooouno_ignore_import_error"] = "True" # must be string

When building with `Sphinx`_ and `autodoc`_ it may be necessary to exclude uno related imports.
This can be accomplished using the `autodoc_mock_imports <https://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master/usage/extensions/autodoc.html#confval-autodoc_mock_imports>`_ option.

.. code-block:: python

    # docs conf.py
    autodoc_mock_imports = ['uno', 'unohelper', 'com']

For a reference see ``ooo-dev-tools`` `conf.py <https://github.com/Amourspirit/python_ooo_dev_tools/blob/main/docs/conf.py>`__.

Enum Protocols
--------------

As mentioned above there are no enum classes in API only enum members.

For this reason this package implements protocols for enums.

.. code-block:: python

    from com.sun.star.beans.PropertyState import DIRECT_VALUE
    # DIRECT_VALUE is a type of PropertyStateProto

The implemented protocol for ``PropertyState`` is as follows:

.. code-block:: python

    class PropertyStateProto(Protocol):
        """Protocol for PropertyState"""

        @property
        def typeName(self) -> Literal["com.sun.star.beans.PropertyState"]:
            ...
        value: Any
        AMBIGUOUS_VALUE: PropertyStateProto
        DEFAULT_VALUE: PropertyStateProto
        DIRECT_VALUE: PropertyStateProto

Implemented methods such as ``com.sun.star.beans.PropertyState.XPropertyState.getPropertyState()`` return a protocol, in this case ``PropertyStateProto``.

If you need to import a protocol for type hinting in your project then it will need to be guarded.

Type Guarding Protocol
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Since ``typing.TYPE_CHECKING`` is always ``False`` at runtime we can use it.

There are two way to handle importing a protocol class.
The first way is by importing ``annotations``

.. code-block:: python

    from __future__ import annotations
    import uno
    from com.sun.star.sheet.SolverConstraintOperator import SolverConstraintOperatorProto
    # ...

    def solve_operation(value: int, x: SolverConstraintOperatorProto) -> int:
        ...

Note when using ``annotations`` the ``cast`` to protocol must be wrapped in a string.

.. code-block:: python

    from typing import cast
    from com.sun.star.sheet.SolverConstraintOperator import SolverConstraintOperatorProto
    from ooo.dyn.sheet.solver_constraint_operator import SolverConstraintOperator
    # ...

    # SolverConstraintOperatorProto must be wrapped in a string
    # if it has not been assigned to object at runtime.
    solve_operation(
        11, cast("SolverConstraintOperatorProto", SolverConstraintOperator.BINARY)
    )

The other way is to assign the protocol class as an object at runtime.

.. code-block:: python

    from typing import TYPE_CHECKING
    import uno
    from com.sun.star.sheet.SolverConstraintOperator import SolverConstraintOperatorProto

    if TYPE_CHECKING:
        # While writing code we have the advantages of protocol
        from com.sun.star.sheet.SolverConstraintOperator import SolverConstraintOperatorProto
    else:
        # code is executing. Now protocol is an object and basically ignored
        SolverConstraintOperatorProto = object
